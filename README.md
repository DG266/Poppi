# Overview
Rookie is a desktop application (written in Java + JavaFX) that allows you to play chess against an AI (or another human). 
The AI is based on the well-known minimax algorithm with several improvements such as:
- Alpha-Beta Pruning;
- Move ordering (using MVV-LVA heuristic);
- Killer moves;
- Quiescence search.

Rookie allows you to customize the AI behaviour by modifying various parameters like:
- search depth;
- evaluation function;
- search algorithm.

The application can be further improved (a lot actually!). In this repository, in addition to the source code, you will also find the documentation (in italian) of the project.
It has been developed for the "Fondamenti di Intelligenza Artificiale" course of the University of Salerno.
